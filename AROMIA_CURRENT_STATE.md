# Aromia — Current Operational State

This file is the compact relay for the command:

> **Continúa Aromia desde el repo.**

It indexes the latest verified operational state. Git history, checkpoints and canonical workflow documents remain authoritative evidence.

## Mandatory actor order

Default production order:

`Cowork → Code → ChatGPT → Code → OMNI → Code → Production`

Routine editorial loop is governed by `AROMIA_EDITORIAL_WORKFLOW.md`. `main` is the canonical remote source of truth.

Every actor must also obey:

`docs/operations/AROMIA_ACTOR_TURN_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`

A meaningful turn is not operationally complete until the next actor can continue from the repository without needing the previous chat.

## Current relay

```text
STATE_VERSION: 41
UPDATED_AT: 2026-09-04
LAST_ACTOR: Code
LAST_ACTION: implemented the full visual-UX Art Direction closeout (art-direction/AROMIA_VISUAL_UX_ART_DIRECTION_CLOSEOUT_2026-09-03.md) on branch `feat/visual-ux-art-direction-closeout`, commit 30a4742. Magazine M3/M4: EditorialArchive now gives the lead and one sparse rest row a story-owned visual, wired only to already-approved slots, no image adjacency between unrelated stories. Ropion S5-A: documentary rose+patchouli diptych (two independent frames, not a collage) after "la técnica tiene nombre: sobredosis". Ropion S5-B: typographic omission pause (Hedione / Iso E Super) after "Lo que decidió no usar", no lab imagery. Saber SB2: olfactory pyramid rebuilt as a semantic <ol> with time range/role/materials per phase plus an aria-hidden time axis. Saber SB3: documentary materia band (bergamota, rosa, sándalo, incienso, salvia sclarea, pachulí) linking each material to its Discovery family route. Saber SB5: implementation-native history timeline, no faux archival imagery. Personas: Alberto Morillas and Christine Nagel now show real, rights-cleared portraits (CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons) with a visible credit line and provenance in perfumers.ts; every other perfumer keeps the monogram fallback. 7 new documentary/portrait assets ingested under apps/web/public/editorial-v1/ and apps/web/public/personas/, each license/author verified live via the Wikimedia Commons imageinfo API immediately before download. No image generation was used anywhere in this turn. tsc --noEmit and next lint clean; all touched routes verified 200 with correct DOM (alt text, captions, provenance, family links, no image adjacency) via local dev server — Tailwind utility compilation and next/font are broken in this local environment (pre-existing, documented in CLAUDE.md), so pixel-level layout is unverified locally.
ACTIVE_OBJECTIVE: get this PR through CI, merged to main and deployed, then have OMNI run the rendered-experience gate against the live deployment. Separately, the sub-batch-01 visual-generation stream remains gated at 02A and must resume only in a genuinely clean visual-only context — unrelated to this PR.

NEXT_ACTOR: Brey / CI to get the PR merged and deployed; then OMNI for the rendered-experience gate against the live deployment. Separate sub-batch-01 generation remains a later ChatGPT Visual Assets task in a NEW clean context, starting only at 02A.
NEXT_ACTION: open/merge the PR for feat/visual-ux-art-direction-closeout, confirm the CI build and Railway deploy succeed, then have OMNI run the rendered-experience gate (responsive viewports, provenance spot-check, no image adjacency) against the deployed commit. Separately, resume sub-batch-01 at 02A only from a clean visual-only generation context.
BLOCKERS: NO PROJECT BLOCKER for the visual-UX implementation — it is code-complete, pending merge. Rights blocker remains for real portraits of Francis Kurkdjian, Jacques Polge, Olivier Polge, Dominique Ropion, Anne Flipo, Quentin Bisch, Olivier Cresp, Nathalie Lorson, Frank Voelkl and Alessandro Gualtieri; keep the existing monogram fallback until a reusable source is verified. Sub-batch-01 generation is context-blocked only in that separate conversation and remains gated at 02A.
```

## Mandatory turn-closure rule

All Aromia actors must leave a durable handoff at the end of meaningful work. The canonical protocol is:

`docs/operations/AROMIA_ACTOR_TURN_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`

Core requirement:

> **Do the work. Persist the truth. Name the next actor. Leave no conversational archaeology for the next shift.**

The Publisher must not routinely carry summaries between actors. If a binary cannot move through available connectors, the Publisher may transport the file, but the repository must already contain the semantic handoff, checksum/path and exact ingestion instructions.

## Design system — canonical rule

Canonical contract:

`AROMIA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

Canonical semantic visual layer:

`apps/web/src/app/design-tokens.css`

Core rule:

> **Composition may vary. Identity does not reset.**

The semantic layer loads after legacy global styles and bridges compatibility aliases such as `--bg`, `--text`, `--line`, `--surface` and `--soft`, allowing existing Tailwind/global consumers to inherit the canonical system while migration remains incremental.

Do not perform mass token replacement merely for purity. New work and touched repeated semantics should consume tokens/primitives; composition-specific geometry may remain local when justified.

## UX / UI / information architecture — implemented baseline

Source audit:

`audits/AROMIA_UX_UI_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_2026-09-02.md`

Implementation closeout:

`audits/AROMIA_UX_UI_IMPLEMENTATION_CLOSEOUT_2026-09-02.md`

Rendered/browser QA closeout:

`audits/AROMIA_RENDER_QA_CLOSEOUT_2026-09-02.md`

Primary principle:

> **Every click should preserve orientation, editorial context and a plausible next move.**

The current mental model is:

- Home = current editorial cover
- Historias = archive + reading territory
- Saber = reference/context territory
- Personas = people/authorship territory
- Discovery = exploratory/personal journey, including Quiz onboarding and perfume reference objects
- Club = future/community continuation, explicitly not yet a complete product
- Buscar = utility across fragancias and the editorial archive

The technical routes `/magazine`, `/academia`, `/perfumistas`, `/quiz` and `/catalogo/[slug]` may retain historical names for compatibility, but their user-facing semantic roles are defined above.

## Verification evidence

Production baseline:

`7315d3f2fd94b037c73dd047cd8f5e13fbcb0409`

GitHub v2.0 CI run `33660677100`: **SUCCESS**.

GitHub Aromia Strict Audit run `33660677741`: **SUCCESS**.

Railway production deployment `d33eaf73-2805-49cd-a1c9-3e495ef43bb5`: **SUCCESS**.

Railway runtime preflight reported private catalog count 125 and Next.js ready in 524ms. Production build compiled and generated 29/29 static pages.

### Rendered/browser evidence

The browser evidence gap is closed for this baseline.

OMNI verified Render QA deployment `509bee11-a90a-4f5b-8efc-ae37953a7b6b` observed production with Chromium/Playwright at 390×844 and 1280×900 across 11 public routes. Final summary: **11 PASS, 0 REVIEW, 0 FAIL**.

The final technical gate reported no blocking horizontal overflow, clipped text, console errors or page errors. Every route produced screenshot evidence. Context-sensitive composition heuristics remain in the evidence ledger but do not change a strict technical release state without Taste/human interpretation.

Discovery's three mobile lazy-image DOM findings were independently checked against their same-origin endpoints and all three returned reachable image responses. They therefore did not represent missing origin assets.

This is real browser/runtime QA, but it is not a claim that every generated screenshot received a manual aesthetic critique in this session. Future art-direction review should use the screenshots as visual evidence where relevant.

## Voice evolution — canonical source

The Publisher conversation analyzed on 2026-09-02 is a canonical **method** source for Aromia voice evolution.

Source analysis:

`research/aromia-voice-chat-analysis-2026-09-02.md`

Central distinction:

> **Preserve live reasoning, not transcription artifacts. Complete the thought. Never invent the life that supposedly produced it.**

## Visual-generation isolation — canonical rule

Canonical protocol:

`docs/operations/AROMIA_VISUAL_GENERATION_ISOLATION_PROTOCOL.md`

Core rule:

> **Operational context decides what to make. Clean visual context makes the image. Quarantine decides whether the image is allowed back into Aromia. Narrative fidelity decides whether generation may continue.**

Do not generate publication imagery from an operationally contaminated repo/QA conversation. Do not treat generic perfume shorthand as a valid substitute for a story-specific scene. Batch generation advances only after the current asset passes its exact narrative test. Two consecutive UI/workflow drifts permanently disqualify that conversation from further generation.

## El coleccionista release lock

`El coleccionista` is LIVE. Its corrected local annotation contrast passes the verified technical OMNI browser gate in both tested viewports.

Narrative test for Asset A remains:

> **“Yo conozco ese estante.”**

Do not reopen or redesign the story without new evidence or explicit Publisher direction.

## Continuation rules

On **Continúa Aromia desde el repo**:

1. verify remote state;
2. read this relay and referenced handoffs;
3. execute the role-ready work without routine Publisher coordination;
4. preserve approved work unless evidence requires correction;
5. obey `docs/operations/AROMIA_ACTOR_TURN_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` before ending the turn;
6. update this relay at phase end when operational state/next actor changes;
7. escalate only genuine strategic, legal/rights, credential, irreversible publication or material-spending decisions.

For original-image generation, also read and obey the visual-generation isolation protocol and the active batch quarantine ledger.

Authority order:

`verifiable remote head + newest checkpoint/handoff → this relay → older handoffs → conversational memory`.
